    Using the script from the root of the repository

    ```bash
    sh ./scripts/initSession.sh sessions/restfulBooker/YOUR_CLEVER_HANDLE
    ```

3. Perform your testing taking notes of your actions in process.
    - Rename  `sessions/restfulBooker/YOUR_CLEVER_HANDLE/session.XX.md` to `session.01.md`
    - Record your notes in the markdown file
    - Place screenshots or other files in `sessions/restfulBooker/YOUR_CLEVER_HANDLE/data`

4. Commit & Push Changes

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial session notes"
    git push -u origin branch_name_here
    ```
